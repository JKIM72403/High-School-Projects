DESCRIPTION: This application is used to track and organize students. The program contains features for sorting students 
into a chosen group size (sex, major, and in random order), an attendance tracker, and a predicted grade generator.
The program was made to use a .CSV file and allows the user to interact and edit with it through a designed graphical 
interface in Python.

NOTE: The .CSV file in this folder is a sample file that I used to test out some of the functionality of my program. Please download it.
