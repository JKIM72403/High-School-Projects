# High-School-Projects

Hello! My name is Jonathan Kim. I am currently a College Freshman pursuing a Computer Science Degree at Wheaton College. 
This repository is PYTHON focused as that is the language I studied in Highschool.
This highschool class was my first interaction with Coding and Computer Science. 
As such, the projects in this repository are from that International Baccalaureate Computer Science class. With these projects, I was predicted a 7/7.
The class focused on OOP and Functional programming.

I will be learning JAVA later this year and completely anticipate that I will be competently fluent.
